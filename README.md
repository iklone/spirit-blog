# Spirit Blog
A two faced blog for my own use. Built on JS with flexbox.

The site can be viewed through two stylings: heaven and hell. Each styling will hold a functionally separate blog splitting my articles into two types.
It currently runs with test images and without a database.

To connect to a database edit the `connectExample.php` file to include your DB credentials. Then rename the file to `connect.php`.
